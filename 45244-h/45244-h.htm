    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And all along where Lindis flows

    <p>
      To where the goodly vessels lie,

    <p class="indent5">
      And where the lordly steeple shows.

    <p>
      "For evil news from Mabelthorpe,

      I looked without, and lo! my sonne
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Came riding downe with might and main:

      Till all the welkin rang again,

      "Elizabeth! Elizabeth!"

      "The olde sea wall (he cried) is downe,

    <p>
      He shook as one that looks on death:

    <p>
      "God save you, mother!" straight he saith;

      "Where is my wife, Elizabeth?"

      "Good sonne, where Lindis winds away

      To right, to left, "Ho Enderby!"

    <p>
      They rang "The Brides of Enderby!"

      With that he cried and beat his breast;

    <p class="indent5">
      For, lo! along the river's bed
    </p>
    <p>
      A mighty eygre reared his crest,

    <p class="indent5">
      And up the Lindis raging sped.

      Or like a demon in a shroud.

    <p class="indent5">
      Shook all her trembling bankes amaine;

    <p class="indent5">
      Flung uppe her weltering walls again.

    <p>
      Then beaten foam flew round about&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all the mighty floods were out.

    <p class="indent5">
      The heart had hardly time to beat,

    <p>
      Before a shallow seething wave

    <p class="indent5">
      Sobbed in the grasses at oure feet:
    </p>
    <p>
      The feet had hardly time to flee
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it brake against the knee,
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the world was in the sea.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the roofe we sate that night,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The noise of bells went sweeping by:

    <p class="indent5">
      Stream from the church tower, red and high&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A lurid mark and dread to see;
    </p>

      And awsome bells they were to mee,
    </p>
    <p>
      That in the dark rang "Enderby."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They rang the sailor lads to guide
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      From roofe to roofe who fearless rowed;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I&mdash;my sonne was at my side,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And yet the ruddy beacon glowed:
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he moaned beneath his breath,
    </p>
    <p>
      "O come in life, or come in death!
    </p>
    <p>
      O lost! my love, Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And didst thou visit him no more?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Thou didst, thou didst, my daughter deare;

      The waters laid thee at his doore,

      Ere yet the early dawn was clear.

    <p>
      The lifted sun shone on thy face,

    <p>
      Downe drifted to thy dwelling-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That flow strewed wrecks about the grass,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That ebbe swept out the flocks to sea;

    <p>
      A fatal ebbe and flow, alas!

      about the house,
    </p>
    <p>
      At evenfall, in noon-tide glare;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the silent hills looked forth
    </p>
    <p>
      The many-windowed House of Quair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The peacock on the terrace screamed;
    </p>
    <p>
      Browsed on the lawn the timid hare;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great trees grew i' the avenue,
    </p>
    <p>
      Calm by the sheltered House of Quair.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The pool was still; around its brim
    </p>
    <p>
      The alders sickened all the air;
    </p>
    <p>
      There came no murmur from the streams,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though nigh flowed Leithen, Tweed, and

    <p class="indent5">
      Quair.

      The days hold on their wonted pace,
    </p>
    <p>
      And men to court and camp repair,
    </p>
    <p>
      Their part to fill, of good or ill,
    </p>
    <p>
      While women keep the House of Quair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And one is clad in widow's weeds,
    </p>
    <p>
      And one is maiden-like and fair,
    </p>
    <p>
      And day by day they seek the paths
    </p>
    <p>
      About the lonely fields of Quair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the trout leap in the streams,
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer clouds reflected there,
    </p>
    <p>
      The maiden loves in pensive dreams

      Sits stately in her oaken chair&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A stately dame of ancient name&mdash;

      The Mother of the House of Quair.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter broiders by her side,
    </p>
    <p>
      With heavy drooping golden hair,
    </p>
    <p>
      And listens to her frequent plaint,&mdash;

      "I'll fare the Brides that come to Quair.

      <br />

      They bade her from the window look,

    <p>
      Among whose ways the quiet days

      The sward to the strokes of the favourite

      She shorten'd her stride as we raced at the

      glitter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A wide scarlet nostril flashed close to my knee,

      caught her,

    <p class="indent5">
      The space that he cleared was a caution to see.

    <p class="indent5">
      A length to the front went the rider in green;

      bit,

    <p class="indent5">
      Brush'd lightly, our stirrups clash'd loud as

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A rise steeply sloping, a fence with stone

    <p class="indent5">
      I flogg'd up the straight, and he led sitting

    <p class="indent10">
      her,

    <p class="indent5">
      And up to his girth, to his breast-plate she

      drew;

      A short prayer from Neville just reach'd me,

      "The devil,"

    </p>
    <p>
      A hum of hoarse cheering, a dense crowd

      careering,

      All sights seen obscurely, all shouts vaguely

      Midnight came.

      Midsummer Even,

    <p class="indent5">
      Came a bitter cry,

    <p class="indent5">
      With the auroral flame,

      When One came,

    <p class="indent5">
      Where the roseate rift

    <p>
      Of the boreal blossoms

    <p class="indent5">
      Crossed the snowy drift

    <p class="indent5">
      Straight and swift.

    <p>
      Her robes were full and silken,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Her feet were silken-shod,

      Serene she trod

      The soft sod.

    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the veronica
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Looked out and far away,

    <p>
      A golden wreath around her head
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of light curls lay,
    </p>
    <p>
      And rippled back a shining shower,

    <p class="indent5">
      In bright array.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      About her neck the diamonds flashed
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In rivers of blue fire;

    <p>
      But whiter her soft shoulders than

    <p class="indent5">
      Her white attire,
    </p>
    <p>
      And tenderer her tender arms

    <p class="indent5">
      Than heart's desire.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She fronted full the crimson flood
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of all the Northern space,

    <p>
      And all the hue of all the sky

    <p class="indent5">
      Was in her face;

    <p class="indent5">
      To this place.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A vision of white that glowed to red
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With the fire at heaven, at heart,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor paused nor turned,&mdash;but straight to

      him

      Who lay apart,

      Here thou art!

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first hour after midnight,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As in the eider's nest,
    </p>
    <p>
      The weary head sank soft into
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A heavenly rest;
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it a bed of roses,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or her breast?

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the second hour the cold limbs
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Felt comfort unaware;
    </p>
    <p>
      Flickering, a golden glow
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Warmed all the air:
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it the hearth-flame lighted,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or her hair?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the third hour, round the faint heart
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Failing in chill alarms,
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it some silken coverlet
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Still wraps and warms
    </p>
    <p>
      In close and closer clasping?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or her arms?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the fourth hour, to the wan lips
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      There came a draught divine:
    </p>
    <p>
      Some last reviving cup poured out
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of hallowed wine,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Or is it breath of hers

    <p class="indent5">
      Mixed with thine?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the fifth hour all was dimness
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Alike to him and her;
    </p>
    <p>
      One low and passionate murmur
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Still moved the air;
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it the voice of angels,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or her prayer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sixth hour there stirred only
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The soft wave on the beach;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two were lying stilly,

    <p class="indent5">
      Past sound or speech,

      Came the Queen.

    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes like stars of speedwell

      In slender mould,

    <p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      was the p'int of his precious knife.

    <p class="indent10">
      he always fought most fair,

      grit as any there:

    <p class="indent10">
      what he thought mean.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But his eddication to his ruination had not been
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      over nice,
    </p>
    <p>
      And his stupid skull was choking full of vulgar

      prejudice;

    <p class="indent10">
      fair and open fray;

      Well, we'd jest struck our bit of luck, and were

      Nothing would please his contrairy ideas! an

    <p class="indent10">
      Injin made him rile!

    <p>
      He didn't speak, but I saw on his cheek, a kind

    <p class="indent10">
      of an ugly smile;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I knew his skin was hatching sin, and I

    <p class="indent10">
      kept the Panther apart,

    <p>
      For the Injin he was too blind to see the dirt

    <p class="indent10">
      in a white man's heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, one fine day, we a-resting lay at noon-
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      time by the creek,
    </p>
    <p>
      The red sun blazed, and we felt half-dazed, too
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      beat to stir or speak;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Neath the alder trees we stretched at ease, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      we couldn't see the sky,
    </p>
    <p>
      For the lian-flowers in bright blue showers
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      hung through the branches high.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like the gleam of a fairy-dream, and I
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      felt like earth's first Man,
    </p>
    <p>
      In an Eden bower with the yellow flower of a
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      cactus for a fan;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oranges, peaches, grapes, and figs, cluster'd,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      ripen'd, and fell,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the cedar scent was pleasant, blent with
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      the soothing 'cacia smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The squirrels red ran overhead, and I saw the
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      lizards creep,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the woodpecker bright with the chest so
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      white tapt like a sound in sleep;
    </p>
    <p>
      I dreamed and dozed, with eyes half-closed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      and felt like a three-year child,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, a plantain blade on his brow for a shade,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      even Phil Blood look'd mild.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, back, jest then, came our hunting men,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      with the Panther at their head,
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of his fun was every one, and the Panther's
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      eyes were red,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he skipt about with grin and shout, for he'd
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      had a drop that day,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he twisted and twirled, and squeal'd and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      skirl'd, in the foolish Injin way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To the waist all bare Phil Blood lay there, with
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      only his knife in his belt,
    </p>
    <p>
      And I saw his bloodshot eye-balls stare, and I
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      knew how fierce he felt,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Injin dances with grinning glances
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      around him as he lies,
    </p>
    <p>
      With his painted skin and his monkey grin,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      and leers into his eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then before I knew what I should do Phil Blood
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      was on his feet,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Injin could trace the hate in his face,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      and his heart began to beat,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, "Git out o' the way," he heard them say,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      "for he means to hev your life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he could fly at the warning cry, he
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      saw the flash of the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run, Panther run!" cried each mother's son,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      and the Panther took the track;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wicked glare, like a wounded bear, Phil
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Blood sprang at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the side so steep of the canon deep the poor
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      old critter sped,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the devil's limb ran after him, till they
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      faded overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the spot of ground where our luck was
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      found, was a queerish place, you'll mark,
    </p>
    <p>
      Jest under the jags of the mountain crags and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      the precipices dark,
    </p>
    <p>
      Far up on high, close to the sky, the two crags
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      leant together,
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving a gap, like an open trap, with a gleam
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      of golden weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A pathway led from the beck's dark bed up to
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      the crags on high,
    </p>
    <p>
      And along that path the Injin fled, fast as a man
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      could fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some shots were fired, for I desired to keep the
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      white beast back;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I missed my man, and away he ran on the
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      flying Injin's track.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now all below is thick, you know, with 'cacia,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      alder, and pine,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the bright shrubs deck the side of the
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      beck, and the lian flowers so fine,
    </p>
    <p>
      For the forest creeps all under the steeps, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      feathers the feet of the crags
    </p>
    <p>
      With boughs So thick that your path you pick,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      like a steamer among the snags.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But right above you, the crags, Lord love you!
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      are bare as this here hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      And your eyes you wink at the bright blue
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      chink, as looking up you stand,
    </p>
    <p>
      If a man should pop in that trap at the top, he'd
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      never rest arm or leg,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till neck and crop to the bottom he'd drop&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      and smash on the stones like an egg!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come back, you cuss! come back to us! and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      let the critter be!'
    </p>
    <p>
      I screamed out loud, while the men in a crowd
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      stood grinning at them and me....
    </p>
    <p>
      But up they went, and my shots were spent, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      at last they disappeared,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      One minute more, and we gave a roar, for the
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Injin had leapt,&mdash;and <i>cleared!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A leap for a deer, not a man, to clear,&mdash;and the
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      bloodiest grave below!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the critter was smart and mad with fear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      and he went like a bolt from a bow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Close after him came the devil's limb, with his
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      eyes as dark as death,
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he came to the gulch's brim, I reckon
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      he paused for breath!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For breath at the brink! but&mdash;a white man
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      shrink, when a red had passed so neat?
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew Phil Blood too well to think he'd turn
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      his back dead beat!
    </p>
    <p>
      He takes one run, leaps up in the sun, and bounds
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      from the slippery ledge,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he clears the hole, but&mdash;God help his soul!
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      just touches the tother edge!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      One scrambling fall, one shriek, one call, from
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      the men that stand and stare,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Black in the blue, where the sky looks thro', he
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      staggers, dwarfd up there;
    </p>
    <p>
      The edge he touches, then sinks, and clutches
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      the rock&mdash;our eyes grow dim&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I turn away&mdash;what's that they say?&mdash;he's hang-

    <p class="indent10">
      ing on to the brim!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      ... On the very brink of the fatal chink a
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      ragged shrub there grew,
    </p>
    <p>
      And to that he clung, and in silence swung
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      betwixt us and the blue,
    </p>
    <p>
      And as soon as a man could run I ran the way I

      had seen them flee,
    </p>
    <p>
      And I came mad-eyed to the chasm's side, and&mdash;

    <p class="indent10">
      what do you think I see?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All up? Not quite. Still hanging? Right!
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      but he'd torn away the shrub;
    </p>
    <p>
      With lolling tongue, he clutched and swung&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      to what? Ay, that's the rub!
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw him glare, and dangle in air,&mdash;for the

    <p class="indent10">
      empty hole he trod&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Helped by a <i>pair of hands</i> up there!&mdash;the InJin's?

    <p class="indent10">
      Yes, by God!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, boys, look here! for many a year I've
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      roamed in this here land&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>

      that I think grand;

    <p>

    <p>
      I held my breath&mdash;so nigh to death Phil Blood

    <p class="indent10">
      swung hand and limb,

      the Panther after him,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Injin at length put out his strength&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      and another minute past,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then safe and sound to the solid ground he
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      drew Phil Blood, at last!!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Saved? True for you, by an Injin too!&mdash;and the
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      man he meant to kill!
    </p>
    <p>
      There, all alone, on the brink of stone, I see
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      them standing still;
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil Blood gone white, with the struggle and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      fright, like a great mad bull at bay,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Injin meanwhile, with a half skeer'd
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      smile, ready to spring away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What did Phil do? Well I watched the two,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      and I saw Phil Blood turn back,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bend over the brink and take a blink right down
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      the chasm black,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then stooping low for a moment or so, he
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      sheath'd his bowie bright,
    </p>
    <p>
      Spat slowly down, and watch'd with a frown, as
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      the spittle sank from sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Hands in his pockets, eyes downcast, silent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      thoughtful, and grim,
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Panther, grinning as he passed, still
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      kept his eyes on him,
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil Blood strolled slow to his mates below,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      down by the mountain track,
    </p>
    <p>
      With his lips set tight, and his face all white,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      and the Panther at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckon they stared when the two appeared!
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      but never a word Phil spoke;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them laughed and others jeered,&mdash;but
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      he let them have their joke;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed amazed, like a man gone dazed, the
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      sun in his eyes too bright,
    </p>
    <p>
      And for many a week, in spite of their cheek,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      he never offered to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And after that day he changed his play, and kept
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      a civiller tongue,
    </p>
    <p>
      And whenever an Injin came that way, his con-
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      trary head he hung;
    </p>
    <p>
      But whenever he heard the lying word, 'It's a
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Lie!' Phil Blood would groan;
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>A Snake is a Snake, make no mistake! but an Injin's </i>
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">

      THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>mong the hills of
      India
    </p>
    <p>
      Dwelt warriors fierce and bold,
    </p>
    <p>
      The sons of robber chieftains
    </p>
    <p>
      Who, in the days of old,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fought for their mountain freedom,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, if by Fate laid low,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fell ever crowned with honour&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Their faces to the foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now'twas an ancient custom
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those hillsmen brave,
    </p>
    <p>
      When thus they found their kinsman,
    </p>
    <p>
      To dig for him no grave;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the torn blood-stained garments
    </p>
    <p>
      They stripped from off the dead,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then his wrist they circled
    </p>
    <p>
      With green or crimson thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Many the green-decked warriors,
    </p>
    <p>
      But only for a few
    </p>
    <p>
      Was kept that highest honour,
    </p>
    <p>
      The thread of sanguine hue;
    </p>
    <p>
      For'twas alone the bravest
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those who nobly shed
    </p>
    <p>
      Their life-blood in the battle
    </p>
    <p>
      Whose wrists were bound with red.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they thus had graced them
    </p>
    <p>
      Who fell before the foe,
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurled their lifeless bodies
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the plain below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earth did ne'er imprison
    </p>
    <p>
      Those hillsmen brave and free,
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky alone should cover
    </p>
    <p>
      The warriors of Trukkee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a time of conflict,
    </p>
    <p>
      And a great armed throng
    </p>
    <p>
      Of England's bravest soldiers,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Avengers of the wrong,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marched through the gloomy gorges,
    </p>
    <p>
      Forded the mountain rills,
    </p>
    <p>
      Vowing that they would vanquish
    </p>
    <p>
      Those robbers of the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The road was strange and dubious;
    </p>
    <p>
      Easy it was to stray;
    </p>
    <p>
      And of those English soldiers
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleven lost their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Led by a trusty leader,
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached a fearful glen,
    </p>
    <p>
      And saw a mountain stronghold
    </p>
    <p>
      Guarded by forty men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Guarded by forty veterans
    </p>
    <p>
      Of that fierce robber band,
    </p>
    <p>
      In every face defiance,
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons in every hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back!" cried the trusty leader;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers would not hear,
    </p>
    <p>
      But up the foe-crowned mountain
    </p>
    <p>
      Charged with their English cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      With loud huzzas they stormed it,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor thought to turn from death,
    </p>
    <p>
      But for old England's honour
    </p>
    <p>
      Yielded their latest breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short was the fight but deadly,
    </p>
    <p>
      For, when our last man fell,
    </p>
    <p>
      But sixteen of that forty
    </p>
    <p>
      Were left to tell the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But those sixteen were noble&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They loved a brave deed done;
    </p>
    <p>
      They knew a worthy foeman,
    </p>
    <p>
      And treated him as one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the English soldiers
    </p>
    <p>
      Sought for their comrades slain,
    </p>
    <p>
      They found their stiff stark corpses
    </p>
    <p>
      Prostrate upon the plain:
    </p>
    <p>
      They lay with blood-stained faces,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixed eyes, and firm-clenched fists,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Red Thread of Honour,
    </p>
    <p>
      Was twined around their wrists.

      Then up and spake the Cameron,

    <p class="indent5">
      Lay far across the sea,

      Went down at his right hand.

      Drew near to the waterside.

      Down in the gloaming alone;

      It fortuned that his vassals,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Riding free on the heath,
    </p>
    <p>
      Came on a stone that was fallen
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And vermin hid beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudely plucked from their hiding,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Never a word they spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      A son and his aged father&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Last of the dwarfish folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The king sat high on his charger,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He looked on the little men;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the dwarfish and swarthy couple
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Looked at the king again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down by the shore he had them;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And there on the giddy brink&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will give you life, ye vermin,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For the secret of the drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood the son and father
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And they looked high and low;
    </p>
    <p>
      The heather was red around them,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The sea rumbled below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And up and spoke the father,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Shrill was his voice to hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a word in private,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A word for the royal ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life is dear to the aged,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And honour a little thing;
    </p>
    <p>
      I would gladly sell the secret,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Quoth the Piet to the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was small as a sparrow's,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And shrill and wonderful clear:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would gladly sell my secret,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Only my son I fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For life is a little matter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And death is nought to the young;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I dare not sell my honour
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Under the eye of my son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take <i>him</i>, O king, and bind him,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And cast him far in the deep;
    </p>
    <p>
      And it's I will tell the secret
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That I have sworn to keep."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the son and bound him,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Neck and heels in a thong,
    </p>
    <p>
      And a lad took him and swung him,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And flung him far and strong,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sea swallowed his body,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like that of a child of ten;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And there on the cliff stood the father,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Last of the dwarfish men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "True was the word I told you:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Only my son I feared;
    </p>
    <p>
      For I doubt the sapling courage
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That goes without the beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now in vain is the torture,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Fire shall never avail:

      Here dies in my bosom

    <p class="indent5">
      And his voice grew tremulous.

      SIR ELDRIC

      To reach the haunts of heathen men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      About the dusk he came unto
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A wood of birchen gray,

    <p>
      And on the other side he knew

      The heathen country lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

      "'Tis but a night," he sang, "to ride,

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon came peering through the trees,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And found him undismayed;
    </p>
    <p>
      For still he sang his litanies,

    <p class="indent5">
      And as he rode he prayed.

      <br />

    </p>
    <p>
      Crept from behind and smote him so.

      A BALLAD OF HELL

      Oh, unexpected, dear appeal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She struck a happy tear away
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And broke the crimson seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love, there is no help on earth,

    <p class="indent5">
      No help in heaven; the dead man's bell

    <p>
      Must toll our wedding; our first hearth

      Must be the well-paved floor of hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour died from out her face,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Her eyes like ghostly candles shone;
    </p>
    <p>
      She cast dread looks about the place,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then clenched her teeth, and read right on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may not pass the prison door;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Here must I rot from day to day,

    <p class="indent5">
      I'll take my life; it must be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meet me in hell to-night, my queen,
    </p>

      For weal and woe."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed although her face was wan,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She girded on her golden belt,
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her jewelled ivory fan,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And at her glowing missal knelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then rose, "And am I mad?" she said,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She broke her fan, her belt untied;
    </p>
    <p>
      With leather girt herself instead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And stuck a dagger at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited, shuddering in her room
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Till sleep had fallen on all the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never flinched; she faced her doom:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They two must sin to keep their vows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then out into the night she went;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And stooping, crept by hedge and tree;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her rose-bush flung a snare of scent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And caught a happy memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell, and lay a minute's space;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She tore the sward in her distress;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dewy grass refreshed her face;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She rose and ran with lifted dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She started like a morn-caught ghost
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Once when the moon came out and stood
    </p>
    <p>
      To watch; the naked road she crossed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And dived into the murmuring wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The branches snatched her streaming cloak;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A live thing shrieked; she made no stay!
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried to the trysting-oak&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Right well she knew the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a pause she bared her breast
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And drove her dagger home and fell,
    </p>
    <p>
      And lay like one that takes her rest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And died and wakened up in hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She bathed her spirit in the flame,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And near the centre took her post;
    </p>
    <p>
      From all sides to her ears there came
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The dreary anguish of the lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil started at her side
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Comely, and tall, and black as jet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am young Malespina's bride;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Has he come hither yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poppet, welcome to your bed."
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Is Malespina here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not he! To-morrow he must wed
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His cousin Blanche, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie; he died with me to-night."
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Not he! It was a plot." "You lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I never lie outright."
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "We died at midnight, he and I."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil went. Without a groan
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She, gathered up in one fierce prayer,
    </p>
    <p>
      Took root in hell's midst all alone,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And waited for him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She dared to make herself at home,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Amidst the wail, the uneasy stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood-stained flame that filled the dome,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Scentless and silent, shrouded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How long she stayed I cannot tell;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But when she felt his perfidy,
    </p>
    <p>
      She marched across the floor of hell;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And all the damned stood up to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil stopped her at the brink;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She shook him off; she cried, "Away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you have gone mad, I think."
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "I was betrayed: I will not stay."

      by the morning light,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And it cried in the gray birch-tree,

      "Oh, Bronwen, come to me!"

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Kind Bronwen, come!" until
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not rest, and rose to look

    <p class="indent5">
      To the sea beyond Morva Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Kind Bronwen, come to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Till she could not stay, for very love,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And stole away to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the hill to the fishing-boats,

    <p class="indent5">
      And away she sailed so fine,

      "Is it far, my love, in the summer sun

    <h3>

    <p class="indent5">
      To watch pale Bronwen drown,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sun was hot on the deadly sands

      Before Jerusalem town.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All day Red Ithel lay dying there,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But he thought of the far-off sea;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he cried all day till his lips grew white,

    <p class="indent5">
      "Kind Bronwen, come to me!"

    <p>
      And he thought he lay on Morva Hill
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And heard her call his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her voice, he held her hand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "This is the day," she said,

    <p>
      "And this is the hour that Holy Church

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no strength in him to speak,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But his eyes had yet their say,

    <p>
      "Kind Bronwen, now we will be wed

      Forever and ever and aye!"

      nuzzled against his breast;

      In seventeen ninety famous,
    </p>
    <p>
      King William did- his men prepare

      To fight with false King Shamus.
    </p>

      King James he pitched his tents between

    <p class="indent5">
      And set them all on fire.

    <p>
      Thereat revenge the Irish vowed

    <p class="indent5">
      Upon King William's forces,
    </p>
    <p>
      And vehemently with cries did crowd

    <p class="indent5">
      To check their forward courses.

    <p>
      A ball from out their batteries Hew

      As our King he faced their fire;

      His shoulder-knot away it shot,

    </p>
    <p>

    <p class="indent5">
      Saying, "Gentlemen, mind your station,

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he night before
      Larry was stretched,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The boys they all paid him a visit;
    </p>
    <p>
      A bit in their sacks too they fetched,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They sweated their duds till they riz it;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      * Beggars of those days were required by the law to wear red petticoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Larry was always the lad,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When a friend was condemned to the squeezer,
    </p>
    <p>
      But he'd fence all the togs that he had
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Just to help the poor boy to a sneezer,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And moisten his gob 'fore he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pon my conscience, dear Larry," says I,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry to see you in trouble,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your life's cheerful noggin run dry,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And yourself going off like its bubble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hould your tongue in that matter," says he;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "For the neckcloth I don't care a button,
    </p>
    <p>
      And by this time to-morrow you'll see
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Your Larry will be dead as mutton:
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      All for what?'Kase his courage was good."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys they came crowding in fast;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They drew their stools close round about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six glims round his coffin they placed;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He couldn't be well waked without 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      I axed if he was fit for to die,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Without having duly repented?
    </p>
    <p>
      Says Larry, "That's all in my eye,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And all by the clergy invented
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To make a fat bit for themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the cards being called for, they played,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till Larry found one of them cheated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick! he made a hard rap at his head,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad being easily heated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So ye chates me because I'm in grief;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      O, is that, by the Holy, the rason?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon I'll give you to know, you d-d thief,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That you're cracking your jokes out of sason,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And scuttle your nob with my fist."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in came the priest with his book,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He spoke him so smooth and so civil,
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry tipped him a Kilmainham look,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And pitched his big wig to the divil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then raising a little his head
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To get a sweet drop of the bottle,
    </p>
    <p>
      And pitiful sighing, he said,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "O, the hemp will be soon round my throttle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And choke my poor windpipe to death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So mournful these last words he spoke,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We all vented our tears in a shower;
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part I thought my heart broke
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To see him cut down like a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his travels we watched him next day -9
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      O, the hangman, I thought I could kill him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one word did our poor Larry say,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Nor changed till he came to "King William."
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Och, my dear, thin his colour turned
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to the nubbling chit,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He was tucked up so neat and so pretty;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumbler jogged off with his feet,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And he died with his face to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kicked, too, but that was all pride,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For soon you might see 'twas all over;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as soon as the noose was untied,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then at darky we waked him in clover,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And sent him to take a ground sweat.

      gloomy shore
    </p>
    <p>
      Skylark never warbles o'er,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the cliff hangs high and steep,
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Saint Kevin stole to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, at least," he calmly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman ne'er shall find my bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! the good Saint little knew
    </p>
    <p>
      What that wily sex can do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas from Kathleen's eyes he flew,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eyes of most unholy blue!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had lov'd him well and long,
    </p>
    <p>
      Wish'd him hers, nor thought it wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wheresoe'er the Saint would fly,
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he heard her light foot nigh;
    </p>
    <p>
      East or west, where'er he turn'd,
    </p>
    <p>
      Still her eyes before him burn'd.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bold cliff's bosom cast,
    </p>
    <p>
      Tranquil now he sleeps at last;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreams of heav'n, nor thinks that e'er
    </p>
    <p>
      Woman's smile can haunt him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nor earth nor heaven is free
    </p>
    <p>
      From her power, if fond she be:
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now, while calm he sleeps,
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen o'er him leans and weeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearless she had track'd his feet
    </p>
    <p>
      To this rocky, wild retreat;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when morning met his view,
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mild glances met it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, your Saints have cruel hearts!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sternly from his bed he starts,
    </p>
    <p>
      And with rude, repulsive shock,
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurls her from the beetling rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Glendalough, thy gloomy wave
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon was gentle Kathleen's grave!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the Saint (yet ah! too late,)
    </p>
    <p>
      Felt her love, and mourn'd her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said, "Heav'n rest her soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Round the Lake light music stole;
    </p>
    <p>
      And her ghost was seen to glide,
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling o'er the fatal tide.

    <p class="indent5">
      Killeevy, O Killeevy!

      long, long ago,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When I was a little fellow,
    </p>
    <p>
      A piper wandered to our door,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Gray-headed, blind, and yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And O how glad was my young heart,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Though earth and sky looked dreary,

    <p>
      To see the stranger and his dog,

      Poor Pinch and Caoch O'Leary!

    <p>
      <br />

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Crossbarred with green and yellow,
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought and said, "In Ireland's ground,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      There's not so fine a fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Fineen Burke and Shane Magee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And Eily, Kate, and Mary,
    </p>
    <p>
      Rushed in with panting haste to see
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And welcome Caoch O'Leary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      O, God be with those happy times,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      O, God be with my childhood,
    </p>
    <p>
      When I, bare-headed, roamed all day
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Bird-nesting in the wild wood!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll not forget those sunny hours
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      However years may vary;

    <p>
      I'll not forget my early friends,

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Caoch and Pinch slept well that night,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And in the morning early
    </p>
    <p>
      He called me up to hear him play
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "The wind that shakes the barley."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he stroked my flaxen hair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And cried, "God mark my deary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And how I wept when he said, "Farewell,

    <p class="indent5">
      And think of Caoch O'Leary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      And seasons came and went, and still
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Old Caoch was not forgotten,

    <p class="indent5">
      And in the cold clay rotten;

      And often when I walked and danced
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With Eily, Kate, and Mary,
    </p>
    <p>
      We spoke of childhood's rosy hours,

      And prayed for Caoch O'Leary.

    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;twenty summers had gone past,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And June's red sun was sinking,
    </p>
    <p>
      When I, a man, sat by my door,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of twenty sad things thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little dog came up the way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His gait was slow and weary,
    </p>
    <p>
      And at his tail a lame man limped,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'Twas Pinch and Caoch O'Leary.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Caoch! but ah! how woe-begone!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His form is bowed and bending,
    </p>
    <p>
      His fleshless hands are stiff and wan,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Ay, time is even blending
    </p>
    <p>
      The colours on his threadbare bag,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And Pinch is twice as hairy

    <p>
      And thin-spare as when first I saw
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Himself and Caoch O'Leary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      "Break down the bridge!"&mdash;Six warriors rushed
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Through the storm of shot and the storm of

      shell:
    </p>
    <p>
      With late, but certain, victory flushed

    <p class="indent5">
      The grim Dutch gunners eyed them well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They wrenched at the planks 'mid a hail of fire:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They fell in death, their work half done:
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridge stood fast; and nigh and nigher
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The foe swarmed darkly, densely on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "O who for Erin will strike a stroke?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Who hurl yon planks where the waters roar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Six warriors forth from their comrades broke,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And flung them upon that bridge once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Again at the rocking planks they dashed;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And four dropped dead; and two remained:
    </p>
    <p>
      The huge beams groaned, and the arch down
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      crashed;&mdash;

    <p class="indent5">
      Two stalwart swimmers the margin gained.

      St Ruth in his stirrups stood up, and cried,

    <p class="indent5">
      "I have seen no deed like that in France!"

      He paused perforce to lean.

      <br />

      He leaned upon the garden-gate;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He looked, and scarce he breathed
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the little porch she sate,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With woodbine overwreathed;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes upon her work were bent,

    <p class="indent5">
      Unconscious who was nigh;

    <p class="indent5">
      And oft did idle lie;

    <p class="indent5">
      Sweet fragments faintly sung,

      But ever, ere the notes could close,

      She hushed them on her tongue.

      Those downcast eyelids pale&mdash;

      Two lovely clouds so silken white,

      Two lovelier stars that veil.

    <p class="indent5">
      But one reluctant ray

    <p class="indent5">
      As charmed there to stay&mdash;

    <p>
      It stole aslant the pear-tree bough,

    <p class="indent5">
      And through the woodbine fringe,
    </p>
    <p>
      And kissed the maiden's neck and brow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And bathed her in its tinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! beauty of my heart," he said,

    <p class="indent5">
      Twice faltered, as a woman he had been.

    <p class="indent5">
      Prayed for respite, tho' it is not death he fears;

      With their spindles every night;
    </p>
    <p>
      One and two and three fair Maidens,
    </p>
    <p>
      Spinning to a pulsing cadence,
    </p>
    <p>
      Singing songs of Elfin-Mere,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till the eleventh hour was toll'd,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then departed through the wold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Years ago, and years ago; </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And the tall reeds sigh as the wind doth blow.

    <p>
      Three white Lilies, calm and clear,

    </p>
    <p>
      Listening to their gentle singing,
    </p>
    <p>
      Felt his heart go from him, clinging

      To these Maids of Elfin-Mere;

    <p>
      Sued each night to make them stay,

      Sadden'd when they went away.

    <p>
      <i>Years ago, and years ago; </i>

    <p>
      One that night who wander'd near
    </p>
    <p>
      Heard lamentings by the shore,
    </p>
    <p>
      Saw at dawn three stains of gore

    <p>
      In the waters fade and dwindle.

    <p>
      Nevermore with song and spindle

    <p>
      Saw we Maids of Elfin-Mere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pastor's Son did pine and die;

    <p>
      Because true love should never lie.

    <p class="indent5">
      And donn'd her grandest gear;

    <p>
      And her heart beat fast, when a sounding horn
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Announced a suitor near;

      Hers was a heart so full of pride,

      One suitor there came from the Scottish shore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Long, and lithe, and grim,
    </p>
    <p>
      And a younger one from Dunluce hoar,

    <p class="indent5">
      And the lady inclined to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But hearken ye, nobles both," she said,

      As soon as they sat to dine&mdash;

      "The hand must prove its chieftainry,

      Their lady may count as won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ye both were born upon the shore,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Were bred upon the sea,

      M'Quillan felt hope in every vein

      Chanting the Viking's dirge.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis summer&mdash;the long white lines of foam

      Their eyes o'er the waters stretch.

      Through the links of her golden hair.

      Of his brother boatman sound.

    <p class="indent5">
      He felt the spray in his wake&mdash;

    <p>
      Stately as maiden of high degree;

      And ever and aye by night and by day

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And it befell one noontide hour
    </p>
    <p>
      (Dark was the sky with a glooming shower!)
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A gallant knight his troth did plight

      <br />

      "Haste to the faery who dwells by the sea;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted his charger, and gallop'd away
    </p>
    <p>
      By down and valley and cove and bay:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He chaunted a song as he cantered along
    </p>
    <p>
      By the dismal coast at close of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind blew fresh and the foam ran high;
    </p>
    <p>
      Naught he heard but the seamew's cry,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Till he came to the cave by the crisping wave
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the billow lies calm and the breezes die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There, over the sea-weed and over the shells
    </p>
    <p>
      And the tufted glens and the heathery dells,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      O'er cave and dale, in the twilight pale,
    </p>
    <p>
      The blissful melody floats and swells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight grew faint as he ambled along,
    </p>
    <p>
      And his heart beat high to the charmed song;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Never thought he of the lorn ladye
    </p>
    <p>
      As he tript the pebbles and shells among.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Faery stood in a curve of the sand,
    </p>
    <p>
      And she waved to the Knight with her delicate
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      hand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And on to a light on the waters bright
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed afar with her silvery wand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      (Her tresses are dark as the tangle that lies
    </p>
    <p>
      In the calm blue deep at the red sunrise,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And they never have rest on her beautiful
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      breast,
    </p>
    <p>
      That heaves and falls as the melody sighs.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The fickle Knight follow'd her pearl-white feet,
    </p>
    <p>
      For his bosom was thrill'd with the roundel sweet;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She stept on the sea with frolic and glee,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he spurr'd his charger dark and fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A meadow it seem'd, the bright green sea,
    </p>
    <p>
      It seem'd a level and flowery lea;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Nor foam nor spray was dash'd away,
    </p>
    <p>
      As the good steed over the tide did flee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On to an isle of purple light
    </p>
    <p>
      The Faery led him with rapid flight;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She waved her hand, she poised her wand,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the billows roll'd over the faithless Knight.

      Ah, what will become of the sweet ladye
    </p>
    <p>
      Who prays for her lover on bended knee
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      By the pointed Scar that looms afar

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard a hoof-pace faint and far,
    </p>
    <p>
      As she pored on the pallid evening star.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Through the distant dell arose and fell

    <p>
      The clattering hoofs of a steed of war.

      <br />
    </p>

    <p class="indent5">
      As the sound came near both loud and clear

    <p>
      From the wood lying under the evening star.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo, to the tarn a horseman sped;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale was his face and his eyes were dead;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He lifted his spear as he gallop'd anear,

    <p>
      And on and on the phantom fled!

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      O wildly cried the lorn ladye,
    </p>
    <p>
      And tore her tresses that floated free,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then madly leapt to the tarn that slept
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the cliff by the winding lea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And oft when the sad pale evening star
    </p>
    <p>
      Touches the tip of the rifted Scar,

    <p class="indent5">
      A maiden's cry comes shuddering by,

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like a heathen lord?
    </p>
    <p>
      Go! thy bride the scaffold is:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Give her sigh for sigh,
    </p>
    <p>
      Breath for breath and kiss for kiss!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For Geoffrey Barron must die."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But he laughed out as he ran
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Up the black steps:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never happier bridegroom man
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With his wife's lips!
    </p>
    <p>
      If for some mortal woman's sake
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In silks should go I,
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall for Heaven the same pains take:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Now Geoffrey Barron must die."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet death," he laughed, "that I have
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      wooed
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      On many a stiff field,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet are the eyes below the hood
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To my glad eyes revealed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet death that leads us home to Christ,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Whose leal man am I!
    </p>
    <p>
      And sweet the altar and the priest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Now Geoffrey Barron must die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed the Cross on his breast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then smiled with rapt eyes
    </p>
    <p>
      As they beheld the vision blest
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of Christ in Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      O many die for God and the green!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But never an one saw I
    </p>
    <p>
      Go out with such a bridegroom mien
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As Geoffrey Barron to die!

      Peter Gilligan
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Was weary night and day,
    </p>
    <p>
      For half his flock were in their beds,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or under green sods lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once while he nodded on a chair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      At the moth-hour of eve,
    </p>
    <p>
      Another poor man sent for him,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And he began to grieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For people die and die;"
    </p>
    <p>
      And after cried he, "God forgive!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      My body spake, not I!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, half-lying on the chair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He knelt, prayed, fell asleep;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the moth-hour went from the fields,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And stars began to peep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They slowly into millions grew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And leaves shook in the wind;
    </p>
    <p>
      And God covered the world with shade,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And whispered to mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the time of sparrow chirp
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When the moths came once more,
    </p>
    <p>
      The old priest Peter Gilligan
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Stood upright on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mavrone, mavrone!</i> the man has died,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While I slept on the chair;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused his horse out of its sleep,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And rode with little care.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode now as he never rode,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      By rocky lane and fen;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man's wife opened the door:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Father! you come again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is the poor man dead?" he cried.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "He died an hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old priest Peter Gilligan
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In grief swayed to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you were gone he turned and died,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As merry as a bird."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old priest Peter Gilligan
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He knelt him at that word.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "He who hath made the night of stars
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For souls who tire and bleed,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sent one of His great angels down
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To help me in my need.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "He who is wrapped in purple robes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With planets in his care,
    </p>
    <p>
      Had pity on the least of things
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Asleep upon a chair."
